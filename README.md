# A flask forum app for demonstration purpose

## WIP, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

To setup and run local development server, run:

    make dev-setup
    make run

Then goto http://127.0.0.1:5000/t/

Fabric is used for setup database and deployment, etc.  Make sure it is
installed or run relevant command described in fabfile.py manually.

There is no plan to improve this currently due to time constraint.

A port in hy is here, https://github.com/pyx/hyoid.git
